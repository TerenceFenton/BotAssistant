# ChatBot Assistant

By utilising third-party API like ChatGPT, Azure and Elevenlabs, before you lies a functional AI assistant full of character. In order to use this program you will require personal API keys for each of the aforementioned third-party systems.

This program is still in development as it has now ability to store memory nor maintain a constant conversation at this stage. More commits will be imminent.

There is no license on this program as it is just a fun pet project of mine. But should I make it of decent quality I may consider making it accessible.

Things to do:
- Develop a memory storage system, which includes a function to cull old memory for system efficiency.
- Develop a seperate pynput listener to maintain constant conversation until shift esc is pressed.
- change the activate mic to a different convenient keybind, so that I can work on my computer while the bot is running.
- Change the voice from elevenlabs to a lower quality free version.
